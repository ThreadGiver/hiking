This is an implementation of the A* algorithm to find an estimated optimal hiking itinerary based on topographic maps. 
The cost factor was based on the optimal pace according to the slope using Tobler's hiking function.

Results wise, the Verges-Ceramida Itinerary was estimated to take 418.99 hours, which is a deviation of only 4.5% from Google maps' 401 hours estimation.
Unlike Google maps however, this implementation isn't restrained to pre-existing roads and trails, which is better showcased by the Grand-Canyon itinirary.
